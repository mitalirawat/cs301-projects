# Project 5

This project is for all you movie enthusiasts out there! This week, we will be looking at a data set of about ~1,000 most popular movies on IMDB in the last 10 years. Each movie in the dataset has information like cast, director, rating, genre, runtime, revenue, etc.

We will be working with **strings**, **loops**, **conditionals** and **command line arguments** in this project.

To start, download the 4 files given below into your project directory.

* [main.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/master/fall18/p5/main.py)
* [project.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/master/fall18/p5/project.py)
* [test.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/master/fall18/p5/test.py)
* [IMDB-Movie-Data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerharter/cs301-projects/master/fall18/p5/IMDB-Movie-Data.csv)

Open up the IMDB-Movie-Data.csv file and get familiar with it! Notice how the movies are indexed starting from zero, how the 'genres' and 'cast' are listed as several actors separated by spaces. There's something strange about the column 'Revenue', can you tell what it is?

**A reminder:** You should make your changes ONLY to the **main.py** file.
DO NOT EDIT ANY OTHER FILES.

After downloading all the files into the same directory try running the command below:

```
python test.py
```

and you should see the following: 
```
Your Python version: Python 3.6.5

Running your program with this command: python3 main.py

# Introduction to Command Line inputs

**Important Note:** In this project, we will be working on using commandline arguments to pass inputs to your program. Command-line arguments are specified while running the program file on the commandline. For example consider the following:

```python
python main.py upper "Steven Spielberg"
``` 

The above will pass the two arguments `upper` and `"Steven Spielberg"` to main.py via the command line and are called commandline arguments. We have written code inside the main.py file provided to you to read these arguments and provide to you for use in defining the functions for this project.
In the code provided to you, the command line arguments are called command1 and command2. In the above example, command1 contains the string "upper" and command2 contains the string "Steven Spielberg".
You will be enabling functionality for these command line arguments, so that you can use the functions you write directly from the command line!

There are a number of options that can be passed as command1 and command2 and they are described in the directions given below.

# Directions

It is recommended to follow the order mentioned below to complete this project:

## Step 1:

Read through the function we have provided in the main.py file and understand what it does. 
Try calling the function with different inputs to see changes in the output. To do this run the main.py file on commandline as follows:

```python
python main.py upper "Steven Spielberg"
STEVEN SPIELBERG
```

Look at the `processCommands(command1, command2)` in main.py. The `if` statement compares command1 with `upper` and calls `convertCase` function on command2 to get the output. 

Now, write a similar `if` block for the `lower` command. Use the `convertCase` function we have provided, but be careful! You may need to change some of the arguments in the function call.
Try running the below command and check if your code is working as expected. 

```python
python main.py lower "Steven Spielberg"
steven spielberg
```

Make sure you understand how this works as you will need to code something similar for other functions in this project. 

**For each of the functions you define below, you will need to write similar if statements in `processCommands(command1, command2)`, corresponding to their command line arguments**


## Step 2:

Now, its time to write your first function for the project. 
This function must be called `reverseString(original_string)` and it should return the string that is obtained by reversing the input argument string `original_string`.

Example outputs from the function when its run from python terminal are given below:

```python
python main.py reverse "Apocalypse"
espylacopA
```

```python
python main.py reverse "Python Programming"
gnimmargorP nohtyP
```


For this function think about how you can use 'for' loops and string indexing to reverse the string.

The function should be called if the command1 equals the word "reverse" followed by the string you want to reverse. 
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `reverseString(original_string)` function when the first command line argument is "reverse".




## Step 3:

Our next function checks whether a string is a Palindrome or not. 

**A palindrome is a string which reads the same way even when its reversed**. For example 'Spacecaps' and 'BOB' are palindromes.

The function you are going to code is called `checkPalindrome(original_string)`. 
The function should be called when the `main.py` is run with commandline arguments "palindrome" followed by a string. For example:

```python
python main.py palindrome "Spacecaps"
True
```

```python
python main.py palindrome "Programming"
False
```
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `checkPalindrome(original_string)` when the first command line argument is "palindrome".

**Important to keep in mind:**
1. Note that in output above, the case difference in the individual letters is to be ignored while deciding whether a string is Palindrome or not. For example, both "Elle" and "elle" are palindromes. For this,you might need to convert your original string to lowercase before checking for palindrome. You can use the convertCase function for this.
2. If you look closely, definition of palindrome requires the string to equal its reversed version. That should give you a hint that you can use the function you coded in step 2 to help you out in this function.


## Step 4:

Let's explore our IMBD movies dataset! Open the `IMDB-Movie-Data.csv` file and have a look at the dataset.
We have the following information about each movie: Title,Genre,Director,Cast,Year,Runtime,Rating,Revenue.
Note that each movie also has an index, starting from 0.

Like with previous projects, we have provided you with a function to help extract information from this dataset.

Using the `getNumRecords()` function, you can get the total number of records in the dataset.
```python
>>> import project
>>> print(project.getNumRecords())
998
```
The `getMovieData(field, movie, index)` is a very versatile function, you can use it to get the following information about a movie: Index, Title, Genre, Director, Cast, Year, Runtime, Rating, Revenue. You should pass these as string arguments, corresponding to `field`.

**You need to provide EITHER the movie name OR the index value to this function**


The use of these functions is shown below:

(Passing the movie name as an argument)
```python
>>> import project
>>> print(project.getMovieData('Director',movie='Suicide Squad'))
David Ayer
>>> print(project.getMovieData('Cast',movie='Rogue One'))
Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Alan Tudyk, Donnie Yen
```

(Passing the index as an argument)
```python
>>> import project
>>> print(project.getMovieData('Title',index=21))
Manchester by the Sea
>>> print(project.getMovieData('Director',index=33))
Tim Miller
```


Now, write a function to count the number of movies by a given director.

This function is called `countMoviesByDirector(director_name)` and it should return a number, equal to the number of movies in the dataset directed by `director_name`.

**Hint:** Remember how you worked with the Hurricanes dataset and found the number of hurricanes in a given ocean!

The function must be called when the main.py is run with the commandline arguments "count_by_director" followed by the name of the director.
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `countMoviesByDirector(director_name)` when the first command line argument is "count_by_director".

Some sample outputs of the function:
```python
python main.py count_by_director "Christopher Nolan"
5
```



## Step 5:

Now that you have a correctly working palindrome function, let's apply it to our dataset!

Write a function called `findPalindromeMovie()`.


For this function you need to search for a movie name that qualifies as a Palindrome in the dataset.
It turns out that there is only one movie in the dataset that qualifies as a palindrome. **Hint:** Use the function you have defined above!

The function should be called when the main.py is run with the commandline argument "find_palin".
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `findPalindromeMovie()` when the first command line argument is "find_palin".

For example:

```python
python main.py find_palin
```
(We have not shown the expected output of the above command! You should get an output )

**Here, note that there is only one command line argument necessary, as the function `findPalindromeMovie`does not have any input arguments**



## Step 6:

The next function is quite exciting as you get to create cool passwords from ordinary strings. This function is called `encodeString(original_String)` and it should replace all 'A' and a' with '@', all 'O' and 'o' with '0' and all 'I' and 'i' with '!' in the string and return the modified string.

Remember that strings are immutable in python and you should not attempt to modify the passed in string in place.

The function must be called when the main.py is run with the commandline arguments "encode" followed by the `original string`.
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `encodeString()` when the first command line argument is "encode".

Some sample outputs of the function:
```python
python main.py encode "BALLOONS"
B@LL00NS
```

```python
python main.py encode "password incorrect"
p@ssw0rd !nc0rrect
```




## Step 7:

Lets try to see how many movies in the dataset have sequels. 

Write the `findNumSequels()` function. Find all movies in dataset which have a sequel called the name of the first movie followed by a 2. For example, "Cars" and "Cars 2" are both in the dataset. We want to find how many such **pairs** are in the dataset.  

**Hint**: You may need to use nested loops for this task (loop inside a loop!).

The function must be called when the main.py is run with the commandline arguments "num_sequels". 
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `findNumSequels()` when the first command line argument is "num_sequels". (Notice that command2 is not necessary here)

```python
python main.py num_sequels
```
The correct output of the above is not shown!


## Step 8:

Lets find the main actor in a given movie!

Write the `mainActor(movie)` function. Find the main actor in a given movie (The main actor is considered to be the actor listed first in the cast). For example, the main actor in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is Chris Pratt as their cast reads: Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Zoe Saldana.

**Hint**: Find the index of the first comma in the cast and slice the string. 

The function must be called when the main.py is run with the commandline arguments "main_actor". 
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `mainActor(movie)` when the first command line argument is "main_actor" followed by the name of the movie. 

```python
python main.py main_actor "Guardians of the Galaxy"
Chris Pratt
```


## Step 9:

Write a function to find the movie with the highest revenue released in a given year in the dataset.

This function is called `findHighestRevenue(year)`. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
The revenues given in the dataset are *dirty*, meaning that they are not all uniformly formatted. Open up the dataset and note that sometimes revenue is just a number, while other data entries have a number followed by an 'M'. For example, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' has a revenue of "333.13" while 'Prometheus' has a revenue of "126.46M". 

The `getMovieData` function will return the revenue as a string. You will need to perform some *data cleanup* on your own for this task! 
You need to check whether the revenue is a number or whether it has an 'M' after it. If so, you will need to slice the string before converting to float. 

The function must be called when the main.py is run with the commandline arguments "highest_rev" followed by the year. 
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `findHighestRevenue(year)` when the first command line argument is "highest_rev".

Some sample outputs of the function:
```python
python main.py highest_rev 2016
Rogue One
```

```python
python main.py highest_rev 2014
American Sniper
```

## Step 10:

Lets find how many movies in the dataset a given actor is in! 

Write a function to count the number of movies a given actor has acted in. 

This function is called `countMoviesByActor(actor_name)` and it should return a number, equal to the number of movies in the dataset in which `actor_name` is among the cast.

**Hint:** Get the cast for each movie in the dataset and use the string `find()` function you have studied to check if the actor is listed among the cast, and increment a counter accordingly. 

The function must be called when the main.py is run with the commandline arguments "count_by_actor" followed by the name of the actor. 
Write an `if` block in `processCommands(command1, command2)` to call `countMoviesByActor(actor_name)` when the first command line argument is "count_by_actor".

Some sample outputs of the function:
```python
python main.py count_by_actor "Nicole Kidman"
6
```

**NOTE:**
You may find that the function you write above passes some of the tests we have provided, but fails some others. Can you find out why?
Hint: Some of the string data is *dirty*, i.e. there may be some mismatch between uppercase and lowercase letters and some extra spaces in the actors' names. You will need to use one or more of the string functions you have learnt in class! 
Consider this a **challenge problem** to get full credit on this project! 

### Good luck and have fun programming! :)
